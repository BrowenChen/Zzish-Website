				<h3>Making your first call</h3>
				<p>All calls are made to our API using JSON as the request (e.g. not a parameter). A simple google search will result code for this in many languages. The response is also in JSON format.</p>
				<p>On each device (e.g. browser, phone, tablet) you will need to have a deviceId. If you do not, please use the <a href="/api_docs/rest/api#devices">devices</a> method to get one. You can then create users using the deviceId and the  <a href="/api_docs/rest/api#users">users</a> method. 
				<h3>Starting a User Session</h3>
				<p>A session represents a set of interactions by one user. A simple example is a browser session. You can instantiate a session using <a href="/api_docs/rest/api#sessions">sessions</a>. This returns an id which you can use for its complementary method <a href="/api_docs/rest/api#sessionsstop">sessions/{id}/stop</a> to end the session when you're finished).
				<h3>Measuring Activities</h3>
				<p>With a session id, you can then log actions and activities. Activities represent a time-based event with a start and end time. You can also pause/resume the activity. A perfect example of an activity is a Game. When the user chooses to start a type of game, you simply call <a href="/api_docs/rest/api#activities">activities</a> passing in a unique name describing the type of activity (e.g "SinglePlay Level 5"and the session_id. The method will return an id that can be used in the lifecycle of the activity: (e.g. <a href="/api_docs/rest/api#activitiespause">activities/{id}pause</a>, <a href="/api_docs/rest/api#activitiesresume">activities/{id}/resume</a> and <a href="/api_docs/rest/api#activitiesstop">activities/{id}/stop</a>).
				<h3>Logging Actions</h3>
				<p>Actions represent events that are executed during an activity. Examples include answering a question, viewing a video, clicking on a button. Similar to an activity you can specify a unique name to identify the action. Actions can be recorded using the <a href="/api_docs/rest/api#actions">activities/{id}/actions</a> call.
				<h3>Managing Users</h3>
				<p>In order to support multiple users, the API provides an <a href="/api_docs/rest/api#users">users</a> method which simply returns an id representing that user uniquely. This can be used to start multiple sessions for each user.
				<h3>Managing User Attributes</h3>
				<p>In order to add user attributes to a profile, the API provides an <a href="/api_docs/rest/api#usersid">users/{id}</a> method. Attributes can also be added during creation when calling the  <a href="/api_docs/rest/api#users">users</a> method.
				<h3>Exiting the App</h3>
				<p>When exiting app, be sure to call the <a href="/api_docs/rest/api#finish">finish</a> service. This will close any user sessions.</p>
